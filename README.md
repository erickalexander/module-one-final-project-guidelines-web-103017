# World Cup (WC) Info App

Welcome to WC Info App, an app that let's you easily learn about the world cups

Using a CSV file provided by <a href=https://gist.github.com/leathl16/8c314aee7cbfc2a6cbbd> Lauren Leatherby </a>
a member of the Github community and adding some data myself, I developed a CLI that served as google or wikipedia which automatically tells you data on what you looking for. You can choose between getting information by inputing a certain world cup year or team from a list provided and accessing a FAQ's forum in which you will find questions that are popular and display immediate answers. Go ahead and test your self.

#Installation

Download this file from Github and enter 'ruby bin/run.rb' to to run the CLI.
